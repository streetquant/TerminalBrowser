# TerminalBrowser

> A browser for your terminal — not the web.

You already know how to use a browser: open tabs, name your windows, switch between sessions, search across everything, and nothing disappears when you close it. TerminalBrowser brings that exact mental model to your terminal work.

Each tab is a live shell. Each window is a named workspace. Sessions survive restarts via tmux — invisibly, with no tmux knowledge needed. It’s the browser UX you’re already fluent in, applied to the terminal you actually live in.

## Features

- **Named windows** — group terminals by project or context, just like browser windows
- **Directory-backed tabs** — every tab opens in a specific path, like a bookmark that runs
- **Persistent sessions** — close the app, reopen it, your tabs are all still there
- **Side pane** — search, filter, multi-select, pause, resume, kill tabs (`F9` to toggle)
- **Command palette** — keyboard-first access to all actions (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- **Themes** — built-in light/dark themes with density control
- **Workspace recipes** — save and restore a full set of tabs in one click
